### Introduction to HiC
High-throughput chromatin confirmation (Hi-C) is a process that captures the 3D genome architecture of a given sample. 
The assay interactions between loci that were previously distal, which would be impossible to infer from linear sequencing reads alone. 

The typical steps of the assay include: 
  1. Crosslinking with a small percentage of formaldehyde to preserve genome architecture.
  2. Chromatin is cut with a restriction enzyme(s).
  3. Areas cut by restriction enzymes are ligated together, joining areas that are close to each other in physical space.
  4. A biotinylated nucleotide is added to the ligation junctions.
  5. Proximally ligated undergoes DNA fragmentation as preparation for standard NGS workflow. 
  5. Streptavidin beads are used to enrich for biotinylated proximally ligated DNA.
  6. Enriched library sequenced, and the original location of proximally ligated fragments is identified. 
  7. Results can be analyzed visually to reveal the 3D genome architecture of TADs, compartments, and chromatin loops.
